# GitHub Actions Release Workflow Fix

This document describes the comprehensive fix applied to the GitHub Actions release workflow to resolve PyPI publishing issues.

## Issues Encountered

### Primary Issue
- **Error**: "Metadata is missing required fields: Name, Version"
- **Context**: PyPI publishing was failing during GitHub Actions release workflow

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Incomplete dependency installation**: Using `uv sync` without `--all-extras` flag
2. **Missing build artifact cleanup**: Old build artifacts interfering with new builds
3. **Insufficient package verification**: No verification step before publishing
4. **Unreliable publishing method**: Using GitHub Action instead of `twine`

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Dependency Installation Fix

**Before:**
```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: uv sync
```

**After:**
```yaml
- name: Install project dependencies
  run: uv sync --all-extras
```

**Why this matters:**
- `--all-extras` ensures all optional dependencies are installed
- Important for packages with build dependencies in extras

### 2. Build Process Enhancement

**Added clean build step:**
```yaml
- name: Build package
  run: |
    echo "🔨 Building package..."

    # Clean any existing build artifacts
    rm -rf dist/ build/ *.egg-info/

    # Build the package
    uv build

    # Verify build artifacts exist
    if [ ! -f "dist/"*.whl ] || [ ! -f "dist/"*.tar.gz ]; then
      echo "❌ Build artifacts not found"
      exit 1
    fi

    echo "✅ Package built successfully"
    ls -la dist/
```

**Benefits:**
- Removes stale build artifacts that could cause metadata issues
- Verifies that both wheel and source distribution are created
- Provides clear feedback on build status

### 3. Package Verification Step

**Added comprehensive verification:**
```yaml
- name: Verify package
  run: |
    echo "🔍 Verifying package..."

    # Run our verification script
    uv run python scripts/verify_build.py

    # Additional verification with built-in tools
    echo "Built artifacts:"
    ls -la dist/

    # Check wheel contents
    echo "Checking wheel contents:"
    uv run python -m zipfile -l dist/*.whl | head -20

    echo "✅ Package verification completed"
```

**Created `scripts/verify_build.py`:**
- Extracts and validates wheel metadata
- Checks for required PyPI fields (Name, Version, Summary, etc.)
- Verifies package structure
- Provides detailed error reporting

### 4. Publishing Method Change

**Before:** Using `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@v1.10.3`

**After:** Using `twine` directly
```yaml
- name: Publish to PyPI
  if: ${{ inputs.publish_to_pypi }}
  env:
    TWINE_USERNAME: __token__
    TWINE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN }}
  run: |
    echo "📦 Publishing to PyPI..."

    # Install twine for publishing
    uv add --dev twine

    # Check package with twine first
    echo "Checking package with twine..."
    uv run twine check dist/*

    # Upload to PyPI
    echo "Uploading to PyPI..."
    uv run twine upload dist/* --verbose --skip-existing
```

**Advantages of `twine`:**
- More reliable than GitHub Actions for PyPI publishing
- Better error reporting
- Built-in package validation with `twine check`
- More control over the upload process

### 5. Enhanced Error Reporting

**Added throughout workflow:**
- Emoji-based status indicators (✅ ❌ ⚠️)
- Detailed error messages
- File listing and verification steps
- Clear success/failure reporting

## Configuration Updates

### Updated `pyproject.toml`

**Added explicit sdist configuration:**
```toml
[tool.hatch.build.targets.sdist]
include = [
    "/src",
    "/README.md",
    "/LICENSE",
    "/CHANGELOG.md",
    "/pyproject.toml"
]
```

**Added twine to dev dependencies:**
```toml
[dependency-groups]
dev = [
    # ... other deps ...
    "twine>=5.0.0",
]
```

## Testing the Fix

### Local Testing

1. **Build verification:**
   ```bash
   uv build
   uv run python scripts/verify_build.py
   ```

2. **Package check:**
   ```bash
   uv run twine check dist/*
   ```

### CI Testing

Run the workflow with a test version:
1. Go to Actions → Release workflow
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Enter version: `0.3.6` (or next version)
4. Set "Publish to PyPI" to `false` for initial testing
5. Set "Create as draft release" to `true`

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, the old GitHub Action method is still available:

```yaml
# Alternative PyPI publishing method using GitHub Action
# Uncomment this and comment out the above step if you prefer using the action
- name: Publish to PyPI (Alternative)
  if: ${{ inputs.publish_to_pypi }}
  uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@v1.11.0
  with:
    packages-dir: dist/
    verbose: true
    skip-existing: true
    print-hash: true
    password: ${{ secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN }}
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Add more comprehensive tests**: Include integration tests in CI
2. **Artifact signing**: Consider adding package signing for security
3. **Multi-Python testing**: Test builds against multiple Python versions
4. **Documentation generation**: Auto-generate and upload documentation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No module named 'hypster'"**
   - Ensure `uv sync --all-extras` is used
   - Check that package is properly installed in the environment

2. **"Metadata is missing"**
   - Run the verification script locally: `uv run python scripts/verify_build.py`
   - Check `pyproject.toml` for completeness

3. **"Build artifacts not found"**
   - Ensure `uv build` completes successfully
   - Check for error messages in the build step

4. **PyPI upload fails**
   - Verify PYPI_API_TOKEN is correctly set
   - Check if version already exists on PyPI
   - Run `twine check dist/*` locally

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check package contents
uv run python -m zipfile -l dist/*.whl

# Validate metadata
uv run python scripts/verify_build.py

# Test PyPI upload (test PyPI)
uv run twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

# Check package on PyPI
pip install hypster==<version> --dry-run
```

This comprehensive fix should resolve the PyPI publishing issues and provide a more robust release workflow.
